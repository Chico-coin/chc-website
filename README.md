# CHC Website (Landing + Dashboard)

This is a minimal static prototype of the CHC Token website including:
- index.html (Landing page)
- dashboard.html (Dashboard with sample charts)
- style.css (styles)
- app.js (basic interactivity placeholders)

Charts use Chart.js via CDN. Wallet connect and staking are placeholders for integration.

To run:
1. Unzip and open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Or serve with a static server (recommended for Chart.js): `npx http-server` or similar.

This package was generated by ChatGPT for rapid prototyping.
